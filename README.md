##  Getting Started

###  1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alejoNoB20/WOTECH.git
```
  
###  2. Navigate to the Project Folder
Open the project folder or navigate to it through command line
```bash
cd /porject-folder/wotech/backend
```

###  3. Install Dependencies
Now, you should install the dependencies in both, back and front end.

```bash
npm  install
```

You should do this on both sides, back and front end.

  

###  4. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the project root with the following fields:

```makefile

PORT=8080 (for example)

DB_NAME

DB_USER

DB_PASSWORD

DB_HOST
```

And that's it, you have all setup to start exploring our project.

###  5. Start running the project.
```bash
npm run start
```
or 
```bash
npm run dev
```
The only difference between both scripts is that "start" just run once and "dev" runs with nodemon, which allows you to change anything in the code and the page is going to update automatically.
